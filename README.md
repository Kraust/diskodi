# diskodi - Kodi Scrobler for Discord.

This is a small app for creating a relay between Kodi (through RPC) and Discord (Through the Rich Presence API / RPC)

The Rich Presence API still has several features that are much needed (like dynamic APP names) so this is only a proof-of-concept.

# Enabling diskodi

"Allow remote control via HTTP" must be enabled for diskodi to work. This means that remote devices (such as a Raspberry Pi running Kodi) can use this as well.
